# catbook-react

this branch is a bare bones skeleton for students to use to help them jumpstart working on their own projects. example files have also been included for students to base their own components, schemas, and api off of.

## start up

run `npm start` in one terminal and `npm run hotloader` in another

visit `http://localhost:5000`

## don't touch

the following files students do not need to edit. feel free to read them if you would like.

```
client/dist/index.html
client/src/index.js
client/src/utilities.js
server/validator.js
.babelrc
.npmrc
.prettierrc
package-lock.json
